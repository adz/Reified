# FsFlow Plan

This file tracks only unresolved product direction.
`dev-docs/decisions/README.md` indexes the settled decisions that no longer belong here.

## Remaining Direction

- Keep the public story centered on `Flow` and the `Exit` execution model.
- Keep `Cause.Fail`, `Cause.Interrupt`, and `Cause.Die` as distinct runtime outcomes.
- Make defect handling explicit enough to support a ZIO-like lossless failure story.
- Keep the docs, examples, and generated reference aligned with the source of truth.
- Trim stale proposal language that no longer changes future decisions.

## Done Means

- the docs read like product documentation for the user
- the API reference is useful without opening the source
- every public API is reachable from the side menu
- semantic edge cases are documented and tested
- the project feels like a maintained library, not a design notebook
