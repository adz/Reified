# FsFlow Plan

This file is for internal planning and design rationale. It is not user-facing documentation.

`dev-docs/TASKS.md` is the executable backlog.
`dev-docs/PLAN.md` captures the architectural direction, rationale, tradeoffs, and release checklist.

## Current Direction

The next major iteration should stop treating one `Async<Result<_,_>>`-based `Flow` abstraction as the center of every scenario.

The target model is:

- `Flow<'env,'error,'value>` for sync/result-oriented work with no cancellation token in the representation
- `AsyncFlow<'env,'error,'value>` for `Async`-based workflows in core `FsFlow`
- `TaskFlow<'env,'error,'value>` for `.NET` task-based workflows in `FsFlow.Net`

This split is driven by three goals:

- preserve a strong Fable/core story without task-oriented types in the base package
- allow a task-oriented `.NET` workflow with better performance characteristics
- avoid forcing sync flows to carry async runtime concerns such as `CancellationToken`

## Package Boundary

The intended package split is:

- `FsFlow`
  - `Flow`
  - `AsyncFlow`
  - `flow`
  - `asyncFlow`
  - sync and async combinators
  - cross-target logging abstraction
- `FsFlow.Net`
  - `TaskFlow`
  - `taskFlow`
  - `ColdTask<'value>`
  - task and value-task interop
  - `.NET`-specific runtime helpers
  - `ILogger` adapters and conveniences

Task-oriented concepts should not appear in the public contract of core `FsFlow`.

## Workflow Semantics

The workflow types should be cold and restartable abstractions.

- `Flow` should rerun from scratch on each execution
- `AsyncFlow` should rerun from scratch on each execution
- `TaskFlow` should rerun from scratch on each execution

Hot `Task` and `ValueTask` inputs are interop conveniences, not the semantic identity of the workflow.

When a workflow binds an already-started `Task` or `ValueTask`:

- rerunning the workflow re-awaits the same started work
- the effect is not re-executed
- the current workflow `CancellationToken` cannot be injected into that work

When a workflow binds a `ColdTask<'value>`:

- rerunning the workflow invokes the factory again
- the effect can run again from scratch
- the current workflow `CancellationToken` can be passed in

This distinction must be documented clearly.

## ColdTask

`ColdTask` should remain a focused concept.

The intended public meaning is:

- `ColdTask<'value>` represents delayed `CancellationToken -> Task<'value>`
- it is nominal, not just a type alias
- `ColdTask<Result<'value,'error>>` is the typed-failure cold-task shape
- there should be no separate `ColdTaskResult` abstraction

`ColdTask` should be the preferred interop shape when restartability and runtime token fidelity matter.

`ColdTask` does not guarantee meaningful cancellation behavior. An implementation may ignore the token and still be a valid cold task because it remains deferred and restartable.

## Bind Surface

The intended bind surface is:

- `flow {}`
  - plain values
  - `Result<'value,'error>`
  - sync-only helpers
- `asyncFlow {}`
  - `Flow`
  - `Async<'value>`
  - `Async<Result<'value,'error>>`
  - and, when `FsFlow.Net` is referenced, task-oriented lifts
- `taskFlow {}`
  - `Flow`
  - `Async<'value>`
  - `Async<Result<'value,'error>>`
  - `Task`
  - `Task<'value>`
  - `Task<Result<'value,'error>>`
  - `ValueTask`
  - `ValueTask<'value>`
  - `ValueTask<Result<'value,'error>>`
  - `ColdTask<'value>`
  - `ColdTask<Result<'value,'error>>`

The sync builder should no longer directly bind task-oriented shapes.

### Extension-Member Confirmation

Confirmed for task 4:

- F# computation expression extension members are sufficient for `FsFlow.Net` to add task-oriented `Bind` members to `asyncFlow {}`
- the core `FsFlow` package can keep `AsyncFlowBuilder` limited to `Flow`, `AsyncFlow`, and `Result` inputs
- a second assembly can extend `AsyncFlowBuilder` and make those extra binds available only when that assembly is referenced and its namespace/module is opened

The practical packaging consequence is:

- `FsFlow` should continue to define the base `AsyncFlowBuilder`
- `FsFlow.Net` can add task-oriented builder extensions in an auto-open module under the `FsFlow.Net` namespace
- consumers that reference only `FsFlow` will continue to get compile-time rejection for task inputs in `asyncFlow {}`

## ValueTask Direction

`ValueTask` should be treated as a first-class input in `.NET` builders.

Decision for task 17:

- `TaskFlow` should remain internally `Task`-backed for its execution backbone
- `ValueTask` should remain a first-class boundary and interop shape, not the stored execution representation
- `TaskFlow.run` and the underlying representation should continue to normalize execution to `Task<Result<'value, 'error>>`

Rationale:

- `TaskFlow` is a cold, restartable workflow type, and its implementation stores and reuses composed operations across helper layers
- `ValueTask` is awkward as a reusable stored backbone because it carries single-await and consumption hazards that do not fit restartable workflow composition
- the current builder already accepts `ValueTask` inputs and converts them to `Task` at the boundary, so callers still get broad interop without pushing `ValueTask` pitfalls into the core representation
- the shared combinator design is simpler and more uniform when `TaskFlow` composes one owned `Task<Result<_,_>>` shape
- no benchmark evidence currently justifies paying the correctness and maintenance cost of a `ValueTask`-based backbone

Important distinction:

- returning or running as `ValueTask` is a boundary/API choice
- being based on `ValueTask` is an internal semantic and implementation commitment

Task 18 evaluation notes:

- a stored `ValueTask` is not a safe reusable backbone for a cold workflow because reruns and shared combinators naturally require the same operation to be stored, passed around, and awaited more than once
- Microsoft documents `ValueTask` as single-consumption oriented: awaiting it multiple times, calling `AsTask()` multiple times, or mixing those consumption styles is undefined
- that makes a `ValueTask` backbone hostile to ordinary workflow composition patterns such as `bind`, delayed reruns, environment projection, retry, and any helper that needs to retain an operation for later execution
- normalizing a started `ValueTask` to `Task` exactly once at an explicit storage boundary preserves hot-input interop while removing the single-await hazard from the stored workflow representation
- using `ValueTask` internally would also create DX traps because apparently innocuous code refactors could turn a valid one-shot await into invalid reuse without any type-level warning
- no evidence currently suggests that paying those correctness and ergonomics costs would be worth it for `TaskFlow`

Task 19 decision:

- there should be no separate `valueTaskFlow` abstraction for now
- `ValueTask` support should remain part of `TaskFlow` and `ColdTask` interop rather than becoming a fourth workflow family
- the conceptual split would be expensive because users would need to learn when to choose `taskFlow {}` versus `valueTaskFlow {}` even though both represent the same cold, restartable effect model
- the implementation split would also duplicate builder surface, combinator expectations, docs, tests, and migration guidance for a distinction that is currently just an execution-shape preference
- the current API already gives the main ergonomic benefit that matters: callers can bind and return `ValueTask` directly in `taskFlow {}` without committing the workflow representation itself to `ValueTask`
- introducing `valueTaskFlow` should only be reconsidered if task 20 benchmarks show a durable, meaningful gain and that gain survives the added complexity in API shape, documentation burden, and user decision-making

Task 20 benchmark notes:

- benchmark harness: `benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks`
- rerun command:
  - `dotnet build benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.fsproj -c Release`
  - `dotnet run -c Release --project benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks/FsFlow.Benchmarks.fsproj --no-build`
- benchmark date: 2026-04-28
- runtime used for the recorded run: `.NET 10.0.5`
- measurement shape:
  - 2,000,000 iterations per scenario
  - median of 5 measured runs after warmup
  - scenarios compare the current `TaskFlow` backbone with a local candidate cold workflow that stores `ValueTask<Result<_,_>>` and takes the synchronous fast path when the operation is already complete

Recorded results from the benchmark harness:

- `run/succeed`
  - `TaskFlow`: `27.46 ns/op`, `80 B/op`
  - candidate `ValueTask` backbone: `23.74 ns/op`, `0 B/op`
- `map` chain
  - `TaskFlow`: `301.19 ns/op`, `848 B/op`
  - candidate `ValueTask` backbone: `48.48 ns/op`, `0 B/op`
- `bind` chain
  - `TaskFlow`: `475.12 ns/op`, `1392 B/op`
  - candidate `ValueTask` backbone: `101.25 ns/op`, `192 B/op`
- short computation-expression chain
  - `TaskFlow`: `440.95 ns/op`, `1344 B/op`
  - candidate `ValueTask` backbone: `107.08 ns/op`, `256 B/op`

Interpretation:

- the benchmark does show a real fast-path performance upside for a `ValueTask`-backed representation on already-completed operations
- the gain is largest in composed synchronous-success cases, where `Task`-backed composition currently pays allocation costs for each layer
- this does not overturn the current backbone choice by itself, because the benchmark measures execution overhead on a local prototype, not the restartability, storage, repeated-await safety, and public-surface complexity costs described in task 18
- the practical conclusion is:
  - the `Task` versus `ValueTask` decision is now informed by measurement rather than intuition
  - `TaskFlow` should remain `Task`-backed for now because the correctness model still dominates
  - future performance work should first target reducing completed-path overhead in the existing `Task`-backed combinators before reconsidering a stored `ValueTask` backbone

Task 24 direction:

- the benchmark harness should now use BenchmarkDotNet rather than ad hoc stopwatch loops
- the benchmark story should not stop at one `Async<Result<_,_>>` comparison because the main user question is broader than migration alone
- the suite should keep the scenarios modular so each measured cost maps to one semantic claim:
  - reader overhead through `localEnv`
  - short-circuit cost through `Result`
  - composition depth across `Flow`, `AsyncFlow`, and `TaskFlow`
  - cancellation propagation cost in task-oriented workflows
  - synchronous-success cost for the `Task` backbone versus the local `ValueTask` candidate
- the main published comparisons should be:
  - `AsyncFlow` versus direct `Async<Result<_,_>>`
  - `TaskFlow` versus direct `Task<Result<_,_>>`
  - `TaskFlow` versus raw `Task`
  - `TaskFlow.localEnv` versus manual env passing and `AsyncLocal`
- this gives a more coherent user story than a single "FsFlow versus Async<Result>" number because it isolates which part of the abstraction is paying for which semantic benefit

Task 24 recorded run:

- benchmark date: `2026-04-28`
- harness: BenchmarkDotNet `0.15.8`
- host runtime: `.NET 10.0.5`
- measurement mode for the first published pass:
  - in-process job
  - `3` warmup iterations
  - `3` measured iterations
- first conclusions:
  - `AsyncFlow` is currently about `1.18x` slower than direct `Async<Result<_,_>>` on the late-failure path and about `1.78x` slower on the earliest-failure path
  - `TaskFlow` is currently about `2.21x` slower than direct `Task<Result<_,_>>` on the late-failure path and about `15.17x` slower on the earliest-failure path
  - `TaskFlow` is currently about `3.14x` slower than raw `Task` in the recorded 100-bind composition benchmark
  - `TaskFlow.localEnv` is slower than manual env passing but still faster than `AsyncLocal` mutation in the measured 10-layer reader scenario
  - the candidate `ValueTask` backbone still shows a large synchronous-completion advantage over the current `TaskFlow` backbone

## Option And ValueOption

`Option<'value>` and `ValueOption<'value>` should be short-circuiting inputs.

Current direction:

- allow implicit option binding only when the workflow error type is `unit`
- provide explicit adapters when the caller wants a custom error value
- avoid using `null` as an implicit error payload

## Logging And Capabilities

Logging should work in core across Fable and all supported targets.

The problem is not logging itself. The problem is coupling the core contract to `.NET`-specific `ILogger`.

Current direction:

- keep a cross-target logging abstraction in core `FsFlow`
- add `.NET` adapters and conveniences in `FsFlow.Net`
- make the DX as close as possible to `logError "Text"`

The design pressure here is really about environment representation and capability expression.

Key observations:

- logging is a capability, not a reason to add Writer semantics to the workflow core
- Writer-style accumulation is a different concern from immediate operational logging
- environment shape should make capabilities explicit

Likely design direction:

- core logging helpers should work against a library-owned logging abstraction
- env representation should make the logging capability explicit
- projection-based helpers should remain available
- `.NET` can add `ILogger` adapters and convenience helpers

Anonymous records may be useful for user env composition, but they are not by themselves a full capability-container strategy. They are best treated as one env-shaping option rather than the entire abstraction story.

## Capability System Options

The library should be able to grow a set of capabilities over time while still allowing users to compose their own environments and define their own capabilities.

The design target is:

- high DX
- high performance
- user-extensible capabilities
- no forced dependency on a runtime service container

### Option 1. Named Wrapper Capabilities

Examples:

- `WithLogger<'env>`
- `WithClock<'env>`
- `WithMetrics<'env>`

Pros:

- explicit
- easy to document
- capability requirements are obvious in types

Cons:

- nesting becomes awkward
- composing many capabilities gets noisy fast
- library users may end up with wrapper pyramids

Assessment:

- good for a few focused helpers
- not ideal as the primary long-term capability model

### Option 2. SRTP Or Inline Capability Accessors

Concept:

- capabilities are represented as static access patterns over `'env`
- helpers use inline accessors or SRTP-based member constraints
- users satisfy capabilities with env types that expose the expected members or adapters

Pros:

- high performance
- extensible without runtime lookup
- allows new capabilities to be added without changing the workflow core
- keeps one `'env` parameter rather than forcing nested wrappers

Cons:

- more complex implementation
- rougher compiler errors
- raw records and anonymous records may need helper adapters or explicit projections for the best experience

Assessment:

- strongest candidate for the long-term capability direction
- likely best fit if the goal is maximum performance plus high DX for capability-aware helpers

### Option 3. Typed Capability Bag Or Service Container

Concept:

- env is or contains a typed capability map keyed by types or tokens

Pros:

- open-ended extensibility
- easy to add capabilities dynamically
- can model heterogeneous capability sets cleanly

Cons:

- more indirection
- weaker transparency than plain env values
- more runtime machinery
- higher risk of allocation and lookup overhead
- worse fit for the current library style

Assessment:

- probably too heavy for `FsFlow`
- not preferred unless the project intentionally moves toward a larger effect-system container model

## Preferred Capability Direction

Current preferred direction:

- keep `'env` as a normal user-controlled environment parameter
- support projection-based helpers as the universal fallback
- add capability-aware helpers using a static capability-access pattern where that materially improves DX
- avoid forcing a runtime capability bag

This suggests a two-layer model:

1. universal forms that always work
   - `logErrorWith (fun env -> env.Logger) "text"`
2. capability-aware shorthand forms when the env satisfies the capability access convention
   - `logError "text"`

This approach keeps:

- performance high
- capability growth open-ended
- user-defined capabilities possible
- core workflow types unchanged

## Anonymous Records

Anonymous records are attractive for env composition and should remain a valid user option.

They are useful because:

- they are lightweight
- they compose local capability sets conveniently
- they avoid repeated named-type declarations in application code

But they should not be treated as the full capability-system answer on their own because:

- reusable library constraints over anonymous-record fields are limited
- they do not by themselves provide a scalable mechanism for capability-oriented helper discovery

Current view:

- users should be free to use anonymous records for env composition
- the library should not depend solely on anonymous-record-specific behavior for its capability story

## IcedTasks

`IcedTasks` is best treated as an optional integration target, not as the foundation of the public model.

Useful takeaways:

- its taxonomy distinguishes hot vs cold and cancellable vs non-cancellable task forms
- its lambda-based cancellable task shape is semantically close to the intended `ColdTask`

Reservations:

- much of the taxonomy is alias-based rather than nominal
- the public model of `FsFlow` should stay under local control

If support is added, it should likely be via an optional `FsFlow.IcedTasks` package rather than by making IcedTasks foundational to `FsFlow` or `FsFlow.Net`.
