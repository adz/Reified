description: Use Result, Check, and Refined values for typed failures and domain construction.
---

# Getting Started

Install the focused package you need, or the combined package for all three:

```bash
dotnet add package Axial.Result    # Result composition and result { }
dotnet add package Axial.Check     # reusable, path-free value checks
dotnet add package Axial.Refined   # parsing and refined domain values
dotnet add package Axial.ErrorHandling   # installs all three
```

`Axial.ErrorHandling` installs `Axial.Result`, `Axial.Check`, and `Axial.Refined` and exposes no API of its own —
open the package you need directly.

```fsharp
open Axial.Result
open Axial.Check
open Axial.Refined
```

Already use FsToolkit.ErrorHandling or your own Result helpers? `Axial.Check` and `Axial.Refined` do not depend on
`Axial.Result`, so you can add either (or both) without opening `Axial.Result` or creating builder/module ambiguity.

## The three layers

| Problem | API | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sequence dependent operations that may fail | `result { }` | `Result<'value, 'error>` |
| Describe and run reusable rules over one typed value | `Check<'value>` | `Result<'value, CheckFailure list>` |
| Parse serialized text | `Parse.int`, `Parse.guid`, and other `Parse` functions | `Result<'value, ParseError>` |
| Construct a type that records a successful check | `Refine.nonBlankString`, `Refine.positiveInt`, and other `Refine` functions | `Result<'value, RefinementError>` |

`Result` is the common return type. `Check` preserves the checked value and can report several failures about that one
value. A refinement changes the type, so later code knows construction succeeded.

```fsharp
let parsed = Parse.int "12"
let refined = Refine.positiveInt 12
```

## Continue

- [Result](./result/): fail-fast composition and extraction helpers.
- [Check](./check/): reusable constraints over one value.
- [Refined](./refined/): parsing, built-in refined values, dependent construction, and application-defined types.
