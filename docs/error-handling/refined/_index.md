# Refined

Most domain bugs sneak in through primitives. A `string` that must never be blank, an `int` that must be positive, a
slug that must match a format — the type system happily accepts the invalid versions of all of them, so every function
that touches the value re-checks it defensively, or worse, trusts it and breaks later. Validating at the boundary
helps, but a plain `string` that "was validated somewhere" carries no proof: nothing stops unvalidated data from
reaching the same code path.

Refined values fix this by making the proof part of the type. A `PositiveInt` or `NonBlankString` can only be
constructed through a check that succeeded, so once your domain model holds one, every downstream function can trust
it without re-checking. This section shows how to parse untrusted boundary data into those stronger values before the
data reaches your domain model.

This is single-value machinery in the Error Handling package, and also the foundation
[Schema]({{< relref "/schema/" >}}) builds on: for whole models, refined values usually arrive as schema fields
(`Value.refined`), and `Model.parse` runs the parsing for you. Come here directly for single values or when building
the domain value types your schemas will use.

Use `Parse` for serialized primitive input, `Refine` for built-in refined values, submodules such as `Text`, `Numeric`, `Collection`, `Temporal`, and `Choice` for discoverability, and `refine {}` to sequence fail-fast construction.

## Install

`Refined` ships inside the `Axial.ErrorHandling` package — there is no separate package to add:

```sh
dotnet add package Axial.ErrorHandling
```

## Mental Model

```text
Untrusted Input -> Parse -> Refine -> Strongly-Typed Value
```

By parsing and refining values before executing core business logic, you prevent invalid states from corrupting your domain model.

## Tutorial

Start at a boundary where everything is still a string:

```fsharp
open Axial.Refined

type ProductId = ProductId of NonZeroInt
type ProductSlug = ProductSlug of Slug
type Quantity = Quantity of PositiveInt

type Product =
    { Id: ProductId
      Slug: ProductSlug
      Quantity: Quantity }

let createProduct rawId rawSlug rawQuantity : Result<Product, RefinementError> =
    refine {
        let! parsedId = Parse.int rawId
        let! id = Refine.nonZeroInt parsedId
        let! slug = Refine.slug rawSlug
        let! parsedQuantity = Parse.int rawQuantity
        let! quantity = Refine.positiveInt parsedQuantity

        return {
            Id = ProductId id
            Slug = ProductSlug slug
            Quantity = Quantity quantity
        }
    }
```

After this function succeeds, `Product` cannot contain `0` as an id, a malformed slug, or a non-positive quantity unless code deliberately unwraps and bypasses the refined values.

`refine {}` is fail-fast. Use it when later checks depend on earlier values or when the first error is enough. Use `validate {}` from `Axial.Validation` when independent sibling fields should all report diagnostics at once.
