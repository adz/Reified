# Result

This page shows pure fail-fast logic with standard F# `Result<'value, 'error>`, Axial `Check`, and the `result {}` builder.

Use this section when the code is still pure and one failure is enough to stop the operation. Do not introduce `Flow` just because dependencies might appear later.

## Mental Model

```text
Check -> Result
```

`Check` gives reusable predicates, value-preserving gates, and extraction helpers. The output is still ordinary `Result`, so the rest of your domain code stays plain F#.

## Start Here

- [Tutorial](./tutorial/): builds a validation function from `Check` into typed `Result`.
- [Checks](./checks/): predicate, preserving, and extracting helper shapes.
- [Result Builder](./result-builder/): fail-fast composition over standard `Result`.

## Move On When

- Need sibling failures accumulated together? Move to [Validation](../validation/).
- Need async, task work, dependencies, cancellation, resources, or runtime policy? Move to [Flow](../flow/).
