# Schema

Every application that accepts a form, a JSON payload, or CLI input ends up describing the same model several times:
once as the F# type, again as validation rules, again as error messages and redisplay logic, again as API
documentation. Those copies drift, and the classic validator approach makes it worse — it checks an object that
already exists, which means the invalid object was constructed first and now every code path has to remember whether
this instance was the checked one.

`Schema<'model>` collapses those copies into one declaration. A schema is a portable description of a trusted model's
shape, field ordering, construction, and constraint metadata — and parsing goes through it, so if any constraint
fails, the model is simply never constructed. Holding a `Signup` value *is* the proof it was valid.

A schema is not only validation. One schema drives several interpreters:

- **input parsing** turns raw boundary input into a trusted model or path-aware diagnostics
- **validation** re-checks an existing model through the same constraints
- **contextual rules** decide whether a trusted model is acceptable for one workflow
- **metadata interpreters** read the same schema for JSON Schema, documentation, and UI metadata without running any
  validation

## Mental Model

```text
RawInput -> Input.parse schema -> trusted model | Diagnostics
model    -> Validation.validate schema -> trusted model | Diagnostics
model    -> Rules.apply ruleSet -> trusted model | Diagnostics
schema   -> Inspect.model -> metadata (no execution)
schema   -> Json.compile -> compiled JSON codec (trusted hot path)
schema   -> JsonSchema.generate -> JSON Schema document
```

At data boundaries, newcomer-facing failures use one shape: `SchemaError` inside path-aware `Diagnostics`. Primitive
`ParseError`, refined construction `RefinementError`, and path-free `CheckFailure` values lower into `SchemaError`;
`SchemaError.render` and `ParsedInput.renderErrors` provide default English display strings, and
`ParsedInput.mapErrors` maps that boundary shape into your own domain error union.

Schemas are authored with the progressive typed builder:

```fsharp
let contactSchema =
    Schema.recordFor<Contact, _> (fun name email -> { Name = name; Email = email })
    |> Schema.text "name" _.Name
    |> Schema.field "email" _.Email Email.schema
    |> Schema.build
```

Each field application peels one curried constructor argument, so constructor/getter alignment is compiler-checked and
authoring scales to any field count without a `mapN` family or code generation.

- [Domain Values](../refined/domain-values/): author caller-owned refined values in one module.
- [Redisplay And Field Errors](./redisplay-and-field-errors/): failed parses that keep the user's input.
- [Rules And Policies](./rules-and-policies/): contextual rules and environment-aware Flow policies.
- [JSON Codec](./json-codec/): compile the same declaration into a reflection-free JSON codec for trusted payloads.
- [Input Sources](./input-sources/): HTTP form-like, CLI, JSON-like, and configuration input.

## Package Layout

Core schema metadata lives in `Axial.Schema` and depends on nothing else. Interpreters that produce diagnostics — input
parsing, model validation, and rules — live in `Axial.Validation.Schema`. Policies that adapt those results into
workflows live in `Axial.Flow`.
