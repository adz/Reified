# Error Handling

`Axial.ErrorHandling` adds focused tools around standard F# values: reusable constraints, helpers over
`Result<'value, 'error>`, accumulated diagnostics, and refined values. These tools can be used independently; they do
not prescribe one error model for an application.

The package is useful when ordinary functions need more structure than hand-written guards, but do not need a schema
or an effect runtime. Existing F# and third-party Result helpers continue to compose with it.

The main choices are:

- **`Check`** for reusable value constraints with structured `CheckFailure` values.
- **`Refined`** when a value's type should record that construction succeeded.
- **`Validation` and `Diagnostics`** when independent failures should accumulate with paths or names.
- **`Result` helpers and `result {}`** for fail-fast composition over ordinary F# Result values.
- **`Predicate`** for the underlying `bool` facts when local branching is enough.

These shapes solve different problems rather than forming a required progression. A function may use one of them and
return an ordinary F# `Result`, or expose the more specific type when that communicates useful semantics.

`Axial.Data`, `Axial.ErrorHandling`, and `Axial.Schema` are separate packages in the Data and Schema documentation
site. [Schema]({{< relref "/schema/" >}}) uses ErrorHandling internally, but application code can use this package
without Schema or [Flow]({{< relref "/flow/" >}}).

## Install

This section is one NuGet package:

```sh
dotnet add package Axial.ErrorHandling
```

`Result` helpers, `result {}`, `Check`, `Predicate`, `Validation`, `Diagnostics`, and `Refined` all live in this
package.

## Guides

- [Getting Started](./getting-started/): choose a tool from the package and see the smallest useful example.
- [Result Builder](./result-builder/): fail-fast composition over standard `Result` with `result {}`.
- [Checks](./checks/): reusable, named constraints and how they attach to `Result`.
- [Validation](./validation/): accumulate sibling failures into a path-aware diagnostics tree, instead of stopping at
  the first one.
- [Refined](./refined/): construct values whose types record an invariant.
- [Predicates](./predicates/): plain `bool` facts for local branching.
- [Tutorials](./tutorials/): build a small validation flow end to end.
- [Walkthrough: Registration Desk](./reference-app/): the introductory reference app — all four stages of this
  section in one runnable program.
