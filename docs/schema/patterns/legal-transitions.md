# Model legal transitions

Construction is only the first guard. A valid value can become invalid when application code updates it.

A **transition** is a named operation that changes one valid state into another, such as completing an order or moving a
booking. It may return an error when the requested change is not allowed.

Keep updates in the aggregate module and name them after the business action. Callers then choose from operations such
as `changeEnd`, `cancel`, or `complete` instead of modifying storage fields.

## Make uncertain changes fallible

Changing one end of a booking can break its date relationship, so reuse the constructor.

```fsharp
[<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
module Booking =

    let changeEnd newEnd booking =
        create
            { Start = start booking
              End = newEnd }
```

The type tells the caller that the change can be refused:

```fsharp
match Booking.changeEnd proposedEnd booking with
| Ok changed -> save changed
| Error BookingError.EndBeforeStart -> showDateError ()
```

## Keep preserving changes total

Some operations preserve the invariant by their construction. Shifting both dates by the same number of days cannot
reverse their order.

```fsharp
[<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
module Booking =

    let shift days booking =
        {
            Start = (start booking).AddDays days
            End = (finish booking).AddDays days
        }
```

This function can return `Booking` directly. Keep it inside the module that can see the private representation.

## Use drafts for several user edits

An edit screen often changes several fields before submission. Convert to a draft, edit it, then call the constructor
once.

```fsharp
let edited =
    booking
    |> Booking.toDraft
    |> fun draft ->
        { draft with
            Start = proposedStart
            End = proposedEnd }

match Booking.create edited with
| Ok booking -> save booking
| Error error -> redisplay edited error
```

Do not pass the draft into business functions that expect the invariant to hold.

## Use types for important lifecycle states

When operations differ sharply by state, use separate types so unavailable transitions are absent from the interface.

```fsharp
type DraftOrder
type SubmittedOrder
type CancelledOrder

[<RequireQualifiedAccess>]
module Order =
    val submit:
        DraftOrder ->
        Result<SubmittedOrder, SubmitError>

    val cancel:
        SubmittedOrder ->
        Result<CancelledOrder, CancelError>
```

`Order.submit cancelledOrder` cannot compile because the function requires `DraftOrder`.

Use this for lifecycle states that change what operations are legal. A single discriminated union field is simpler when
all states share the same operations and callers already handle them by pattern matching.

## Keep operation policies separate

A transition belongs to the aggregate when the rule is always true for those related values. Tenant permissions,
current time, feature flags, and operation-specific approval rules belong outside it.

Apply those requirements with ordinary result-returning functions or a Flow policy after intrinsic construction has
succeeded.
