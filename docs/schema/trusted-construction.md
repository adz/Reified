# Construction guarantees

This page shows which correctness claims Schema can enforce and which claims require an invariant-preserving F# type.

An **invariant** is a rule that must hold for every valid value, such as a booking start date not following its end date.
An **aggregate** is a group of related values created and updated as one thing.

## Choose the guarantee you need

There are four useful levels:

1. A raw, wire, or draft value is editable and proves nothing.
2. A successful `Schema.parse` or `Schema.check` result passed that operation's gates.
3. A private refined field preserves one field-local invariant wherever the value is used.
4. A private aggregate plus controlled transitions preserves relationships between fields.

Start with the simplest level that prevents a real problem in the application. Stronger representations add more
construction and update functions, so use them where callers benefit from relying on the guarantee.

## The limit

A library can guarantee the result of its own functions. It cannot prevent a caller from using another public
constructor:

```fsharp
open type Axial.Schema.Syntax
type Booking =
    { Start: DateOnly
      End: DateOnly }

let bookingSchema =
    schema<Booking> {
        field "start" _.Start
        field "end" _.End
        constructResult (fun start finish ->
            if start <= finish then Ok { Start = start; End = finish }
            else Error "Start must not be after end.")
    }

let invalidAnyway =
    { Start = DateOnly(2026, 7, 20)
      End = DateOnly(2026, 7, 12) }
```

`Schema.parse bookingSchema raw` and `Schema.check bookingSchema value` enforce the constructor rule. The public record
literal does not. There is no honest library-level type guarantee for every `Booking` while that literal remains
available.

## Durable field invariants

Private refined fields make illegal field values unrepresentable:

```fsharp
type WorkspaceName = private WorkspaceName of NonBlankString

module WorkspaceName =
    let create raw =
        Refine.nonBlankString raw |> Result.map WorkspaceName

    let value (WorkspaceName name) = name.Value

    let schema : Schema<WorkspaceName> =
        Schema.text
        |> Schema.constrainAll [ Constraint.required; Constraint.maxLength 80 ]
        |> Schema.refine (Refinement.define create value)
```

`Refinement.define` keeps the fallible smart constructor beside the projection back to raw text. `Schema.refine`
applies that definition. Raw constraints can report common failures with familiar codes and metadata; the smart
constructor remains authoritative. If the two declarations drift, refinement returns an error instead of throwing.

Any `WorkspaceName` is valid because its representation is private and every exposed constructor returns `Result`.
The schema participates in that construction; it is not the sole guardian.

## Durable aggregate invariants

Use a private aggregate representation when every value must satisfy a relationship between fields:

```fsharp
open Axial.Schema.Syntax
type Booking =
    private
        { Start: DateOnly
          End: DateOnly }

module Booking =
    let create start finish =
        if start <= finish then Ok { Start = start; End = finish }
        else Error "Start must not be after end."

    let start booking = booking.Start
    let finish booking = booking.End

    let schema =
        schema<Booking> {
            field "start" start
            field "end" finish
            constructResult create
        }
```

The record schema invokes `Booking.create`, and ordinary callers cannot use a record literal. Updates must also go
through functions that preserve the rule. A private constructor with a public unchecked `with`-style escape hatch is
not complete encapsulation.

A private representation costs record syntax. Callers cannot write `{ Start = s; End = e }` or `{ booking with End = e }`
outside the defining module, and a positional `create start finish` loses the field names that make call sites readable.
The next section restores both without reopening the constructor.

## Drafts

A draft is a public record whose only job is to be assembled and edited freely before admission. Give the private
aggregate a draft type, and make the schema's constructor the one path from draft fields to the domain type:

```fsharp
open Axial.Schema.Syntax
type BookingDraft =
    { Start: DateOnly
      End: DateOnly }

type Booking =
    private
        { Start: DateOnly
          End: DateOnly }

module Booking =
    let create (draft: BookingDraft) =
        if draft.Start <= draft.End then Ok { Start = draft.Start; End = draft.End }
        else Error "Start must not be after end."

    let toDraft (booking: Booking) : BookingDraft =
        { Start = booking.Start; End = booking.End }

    let schema =
        schema<Booking> {
            field "start" (fun b -> b.Start)
            field "end" (fun b -> b.End)
            constructResult (fun start finish -> create { Start = start; End = finish })
        }
```

Construction keeps field names without exposing the representation:

```fsharp
let booking = Booking.create { Start = arrival; End = departure }
```

This is the same division the versioned contract chain uses. A wire record such as `BookingV1` is also freely
constructible, but it serves transport and versioning; a draft serves local assembly and editing. The two roles can
share a type in small applications. Name the value `draft`, `wire`, or `contract` so the trust boundary stays visible,
and do not pass either shape through business logic as though its schema had changed the record's constructors.

The draft is not a hole in the guarantee. A `BookingDraft` proves nothing and can hold any field values; only
`Booking.create` and `Schema.parse` produce a `Booking`, and both run the same rule. Code that skips the rule must
change the module that owns the representation, which is a visible, reviewable act rather than a quiet record literal
somewhere else in the codebase.

## Updates

`{ value with Field = x }` is the shape F# programmers reach for, and each level of guarantee keeps a version of it.

**Refined fields, public record.** When every invariant is field-local, the record can stay public and `with` needs no
gate. The replacement value already went through its own constructor:

```fsharp
let renamed = { workspace with Name = newName }   // newName: WorkspaceName, proven at creation
```

This is why refined field types should be the first resort: they leave record syntax, `with`, and structural equality
untouched while making the invalid states unrepresentable.

**Schema-described public record.** Update the record with ordinary `with`, then re-check it to run the schema's
constraints and record constructor against the changed value. With the public `Booking` from the first section:

```fsharp
let extended = { booking with End = newEnd }

match Schema.check bookingSchema extended with
| Ok booking -> save booking
| Error diagnostics -> reject diagnostics
```

This suits models that remain publicly constructible, where `Schema.check` is the admission decision rather than the type.

**Several fields, private aggregate.** When fields must move together — shifting a booking changes both dates — lower
to the draft, edit with ordinary record syntax, and re-admit:

```fsharp
let shift days booking =
    let draft = Booking.toDraft booking
    Booking.create { draft with Start = draft.Start.AddDays days; End = draft.End.AddDays days }
```

The `with` expression works on the draft, so callers keep familiar syntax, and the result passes back through the one
authoritative constructor.

Every gated update returns `Result`. That is the honest cost of a cross-field invariant: an edit can break the
relationship, so an infallible `with` on the validated type would be the bypass this page exists to close. When a
specific transition provably preserves the invariant — shifting both dates by the same amount cannot reorder them —
the owning module can expose it as a total function and keep the proof next to the representation.

## Existing typed values

`Schema.check` is for values whose construction history is uncertain:

```fsharp
match Schema.check bookingSchema importedBooking with
| Ok checked -> useBooking checked
| Error diagnostics -> quarantine diagnostics
```

It recursively checks fields and collections and re-invokes a record schema's constructor. It returns the original
value on success; it does not create a proof wrapper. The guarantee belongs to that successful result flow. A private
domain representation carries a stronger, durable guarantee.

## Recommendation

The reference app uses all three levels deliberately:

- `WorkspaceV1` and `WorkspaceV2` are public wire records.
- `WorkspaceName`, `PersonName`, and `WorkItemTitle` have private representations and fallible constructors.
- `Workspace` business transitions accept only refined fields and return `Result` for relational business rules.
- persisted contracts are parsed again when read; contextual production rules run only at the relevant admission
  boundary.

This division keeps schema metadata useful without claiming that metadata overrides F# construction semantics.
