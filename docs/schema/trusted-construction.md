# Construction guarantees

This page shows which correctness claims Schema can enforce and which claims require an invariant-preserving F# type.

## The limit

A library can guarantee the result of its own functions. It cannot prevent a caller from using another public
constructor:

```fsharp
open Axial.Schema.DSL
type Booking =
    { Start: DateOnly
      End: DateOnly }

let bookingSchema =
    recordFor<Booking, _> (fun start finish ->
        if start <= finish then Ok { Start = start; End = finish }
        else Error "Start must not be after end.")
    |> field "start" _.Start date
    |> field "end" _.End date
    |> buildResult

let invalidAnyway =
    { Start = DateOnly(2026, 7, 20)
      End = DateOnly(2026, 7, 12) }
```

`Schema.parse bookingSchema raw` and `Schema.check bookingSchema value` enforce the constructor rule. The public record
literal does not. There is no honest library-level type guarantee for every `Booking` while that literal remains
available.

## Durable field invariants

Private refined fields make illegal field values unrepresentable:

```fsharp
type WorkspaceName = private WorkspaceName of NonBlankString

module WorkspaceName =
    let create raw =
        Refine.nonBlankString raw |> Result.map WorkspaceName

    let value (WorkspaceName name) = name.Value

    let schema : Schema<WorkspaceName> =
        Schema.text
        |> Schema.constrainAll [ Constraint.required; Constraint.maxLength 80 ]
        |> Schema.refine create SchemaError.ofRefinementError value
```

`Schema.refine` takes the real fallible smart constructor. Raw constraints can report common failures with familiar
codes and metadata; the smart constructor remains authoritative. If the two declarations drift, refinement returns
diagnostics instead of throwing.

Any `WorkspaceName` is valid because its representation is private and every exposed constructor returns `Result`.
The schema participates in that construction; it is not the sole guardian.

## Durable aggregate invariants

Use a private aggregate representation when every value must satisfy a relationship between fields:

```fsharp
open Axial.Schema.DSL
type Booking =
    private
        { Start: DateOnly
          End: DateOnly }

module Booking =
    let create start finish =
        if start <= finish then Ok { Start = start; End = finish }
        else Error "Start must not be after end."

    let start booking = booking.Start
    let finish booking = booking.End

    let schema =
        recordFor<Booking, _> create
        |> field "start" start date
        |> field "end" finish date
        |> buildResult
```

The record schema invokes `Booking.create`, and ordinary callers cannot use a record literal. Updates must also go
through functions that preserve the rule. A private constructor with a public unchecked `with`-style escape hatch is
not complete encapsulation.

A private representation costs record syntax. Callers cannot write `{ Start = s; End = e }` or `{ booking with End = e }`
outside the defining module, and a positional `create start finish` loses the field names that make call sites readable.
The next section restores both without reopening the constructor.

## Drafts

A draft is a public record whose only job is to be assembled and edited freely before admission. Give the private
aggregate a draft type, and make the schema's constructor the one path from draft fields to the domain type:

```fsharp
open Axial.Schema.DSL
type BookingDraft =
    { Start: DateOnly
      End: DateOnly }

type Booking =
    private
        { Start: DateOnly
          End: DateOnly }

module Booking =
    let create (draft: BookingDraft) =
        if draft.Start <= draft.End then Ok { Start = draft.Start; End = draft.End }
        else Error "Start must not be after end."

    let toDraft (booking: Booking) : BookingDraft =
        { Start = booking.Start; End = booking.End }

    let schema =
        recordFor<Booking, _> (fun start finish -> create { Start = start; End = finish })
        |> field "start" (fun b -> b.Start) date
        |> field "end" (fun b -> b.End) date
        |> buildResult
```

Construction keeps field names without exposing the representation:

```fsharp
let booking = Booking.create { Start = arrival; End = departure }
```

This is the same division the versioned contract chain uses. A wire record such as `BookingV1` is also freely
constructible, but it serves transport and versioning; a draft serves local assembly and editing. The two roles can
share a type in small applications. Name the value `draft`, `wire`, or `contract` so the trust boundary stays visible,
and do not pass either shape through business logic as though its schema had changed the record's constructors.

The draft is not a hole in the guarantee. A `BookingDraft` proves nothing and can hold any field values; only
`Booking.create` and `Schema.parse` produce a `Booking`, and both run the same rule. Code that skips the rule must
change the module that owns the representation, which is a visible, reviewable act rather than a quiet record literal
somewhere else in the codebase.

## Updates

`{ value with Field = x }` is the shape F# programmers reach for, and each level of guarantee keeps a version of it.

**Refined fields, public record.** When every invariant is field-local, the record can stay public and `with` needs no
gate. The replacement value already went through its own constructor:

```fsharp
let renamed = { workspace with Name = newName }   // newName: WorkspaceName, proven at creation
```

This is why refined field types should be the first resort: they leave record syntax, `with`, and structural equality
untouched while making the invalid states unrepresentable.

**Single field, schema-described model.** A `FieldRef` pairs a field's wire name with a typed getter and an immutable
setter, declared alongside the schema. Setting through it and re-checking runs the schema's constraints and record
constructor against the changed value. With the public `Booking` from the first section:

```fsharp
let endField : FieldRef<Booking, DateOnly> =
    { Name = "end"; Get = _.End; Set = fun booking value -> { booking with End = value } }

let extended = endField.Set booking newEnd

match Schema.check bookingSchema extended with
| Ok booking -> save booking
| Error diagnostics -> reject diagnostics
```

This suits models that remain publicly constructible, where `Schema.check` is the admission decision rather than the
type.

**Several fields, private aggregate.** When fields must move together — shifting a booking changes both dates — lower
to the draft, edit with ordinary record syntax, and re-admit:

```fsharp
let shift days booking =
    let draft = Booking.toDraft booking
    Booking.create { draft with Start = draft.Start.AddDays days; End = draft.End.AddDays days }
```

The `with` expression works on the draft, so callers keep familiar syntax, and the result passes back through the one
authoritative constructor.

Every gated update returns `Result`. That is the honest cost of a cross-field invariant: an edit can break the
relationship, so an infallible `with` on the validated type would be the bypass this page exists to close. When a
specific transition provably preserves the invariant — shifting both dates by the same amount cannot reorder them —
the owning module can expose it as a total function and keep the proof next to the representation.

## Existing typed values

`Schema.check` is for values whose construction history is uncertain:

```fsharp
match Schema.check bookingSchema importedBooking with
| Ok checked -> useBooking checked
| Error diagnostics -> quarantine diagnostics
```

It recursively checks fields and collections and re-invokes a record schema's constructor. It returns the original
value on success; it does not create a proof wrapper. The guarantee belongs to that successful result flow. A private
domain representation carries a stronger, durable guarantee.

## Recommendation

The reference app uses all three levels deliberately:

- `WorkspaceV1` and `WorkspaceV2` are public wire records.
- `WorkspaceName`, `PersonName`, and `WorkItemTitle` have private representations and fallible constructors.
- `Workspace` business transitions accept only refined fields and return `Result` for relational business rules.
- persisted contracts are parsed again when read; contextual production rules run only at the relevant admission
  boundary.

This division keeps schema metadata useful without claiming that metadata overrides F# construction semantics.
