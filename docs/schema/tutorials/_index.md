# Schema Tutorials

These tutorials build up the schema toolkit one step at a time: declare a schema, parse structured data, handle nested
models and collections, apply contextual rules inside a workflow, and read schema metadata without running validation.

## Guides

- [Signup Form](./signup-form/): declare a schema, parse form input, and redisplay errors.
- [Nested Models And Collections](./nested-and-collections/): an order with an address and line items.
- [Rules And Policies](./rules-in-a-workflow/): accept a trusted model into one workflow but not another.
- [Inspecting Schema Metadata](./inspecting-metadata/): walk the same schema as data for docs and JSON Schema.

Use [Validation tutorials]({{< relref "/error-handling/validation/tutorials/" >}}) for accumulating failures over values you already hold, and
[Flow tutorials]({{< relref "/flow/tutorials/" >}}) for workflows around the boundary.
