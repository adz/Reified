# Constraint DSL

`Axial.Constraint.ConstraintDSL` exposes the common constructors without the `Constraint.` prefix. Open it locally
where a module's purpose already makes the context clear:

```fsharp
open Axial.Constraint

module SignupRules =
    open Axial.Constraint.ConstraintDSL

    let name : Constraint<string> =
        Constraint.all [ present; minLength 2; maxLength 80 ]

    let emailAddress : Constraint<string> =
        Constraint.all [ present; email; maxLength 254 ]

    let age : Constraint<int> =
        atLeast 13

    let handle : Constraint<string> =
        Constraint.all [ present; alphanumeric; noneOf [ "admin"; "root" ] ]
```

The DSL changes vocabulary, not semantics. Every name here returns the same `Constraint<'value>` the qualified name
returns; it is optional shorthand, not another abstraction.

## Type-directed names

`present`, `blank`, `optional`, and the size family pick their shape from the type they are used at, so most of the
time they just work:

```fsharp
let name : Constraint<string> = Constraint.all [ present; maxLength 80 ]
let tags : Constraint<Item list> = Constraint.all [ atLeastOne; Constraint.distinct ]

Schema.text |> Schema.constrain present
```

In each of those the surrounding type is already known, and the name resolves against it.

The one case that needs help is a binding whose only type information *is* the annotation — which is also the
central story of naming a reusable rule. Dispatch runs on the return type, so without the annotation the compiler
has nothing to select on:

```fsharp
let requiredName : Constraint<string> = present
let selectedPlan : Constraint<string option> = present
let requiredItems : Constraint<Item list> = minLength 1
```

This selects a constraint; it does not parse, convert, or refine anything.

## The catalogue

| Family | Names |
| --- | --- |
| Presence | `present`, `blank`, `optional` |
| Size | `minLength`, `maxLength`, `lengthBetween`, `single`, `atLeastOne`, `atMostOne`, `moreThanOne` |
| Comparison | `equalTo`, `notEqualTo`, `greaterThan`, `lessThan`, `atLeast`, `atMost` |
| Sign | `positive`, `nonNegative`, `negative`, `nonPositive` |
| Membership | `oneOf`, `noneOf`, `notContains` |
| Format | `email`, `trimmed`, `numeric`, `alphanumeric`, `pattern` |
| Number | `multipleOf`, `finite`, `finite32` |
| Opaque | `notWith`, `custom`, `customLocalized`, `customLocalizedWith`, `customWith`, `contramap` |
| Other | `describe`, `test`, `guard`, `orError`, `mapError` |

The sign and size names are spellings, not new primitives: `positive` is `greaterThan 0` at the value's own numeric
type, and `atLeastOne` is `minLength 1`. Each builds the same atom its general form builds, so inspection, export,
and generation treat them identically.

### Text sizes count code points

The size family measures text in Unicode **code points**, not UTF-16 code units. An emoji outside the Basic
Multilingual Plane is one character, so `Constraint.length 1` accepts `"\U0001F600"` — where `String.Length`
would report 2.

```fsharp
let emoji : Constraint<string> = Constraint.length 1
Constraint.test emoji "\U0001F600"   // true
```

That is the definition users mean by "length", and it is the one JavaScript and .NET can be made to agree on, so
the same constraint reports the same size in a browser and on a server. Collections count elements, and maps count
entries; the atom is shape-neutral and an interpreter combines it with the surrounding shape to reach `maxLength`,
`maxItems`, or `maxProperties`.

Blankness is defined the same way on both runtimes: .NET's whitespace set plus U+FEFF. Adding U+FEFF makes a JSON
Schema validator's whitespace a strict subset of Axial's, which is what lets `present` and `trimmed` export a
sound `\S` pattern instead of staying runtime-only.

## Names left off, and why

Some constructors are deliberately absent because they shadow names the same validation code is likely to need:

| Left off | Reason | Reach for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `all`, `any`, `contains`, `distinct`, `length`, `between` | shadow core F# operations | `Constraint.all`, `Constraint.contains`, … |
| `check` | shadows `Schema.check` | `Constraint.check` |

The omissions are driven by collision alone, which is why `notContains` is exported although `contains` is not — no
core operation is named `notContains`. `test` has no collision either and is exported.

## Result adapters

`guard`, `orError`, and `mapError` are small structural adapters matching the corresponding `Result` operations. They
live here because `Axial.Constraint` does not depend on `Axial.Result`, so a constraint pipeline can retain its input
and finish with the application's own error type without adding a package reference:

```fsharp
open Axial.Constraint.ConstraintDSL

let requiredName (value: string) =
    value |> guard present |> orError NameRequired

let quantity value =
    value |> guard (atLeast 1) |> mapError InvalidQuantity
```

`Result.guard` provides the same value-preserving operation for code that already uses `Axial.Result`.
