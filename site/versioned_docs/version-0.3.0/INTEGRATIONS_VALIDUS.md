# Validus Integration

This page shows how FsFlow can fit beside `Validus` validation pipelines.

`Validus` is a strong choice when the problem is still validation, especially when you want composition, accumulation, or value-object style checks.

FsFlow can usually begin after that work is done.

`Validus` and `FsFlow.Validate` fit especially well together: `Validus` can handle richer validation rules, while `FsFlow.Validate` stays available for smaller pure guards that feed directly into `Flow`, `AsyncFlow`, or `TaskFlow`.

## Keep Validation Before Workflow Orchestration

The best division of labor is:

- `Validus` validates the incoming model or command
- FsFlow orchestrates the application boundary, environment, runtime, and typed failure

That keeps the validation step reusable and keeps the runtime boundary honest.

## How They Fit Together

Common patterns:

- validate with `Validus`
- convert the final success/failure into a plain `Result`
- bind that `Result` directly inside a flow when the workflow starts
- use `Validate` when you want a smaller pure-guard layer without the heavier validation model

## Why The Pair Works

- `Validus` owns the validation story when composition, accumulation, or richer checks matter
- `FsFlow.Validate` gives you a small, readable bridge when the check is a plain guard clause, option test, null check, or string predicate
- the flow family can then own the runtime boundary without swallowing validation concerns

## Example

```fsharp
let validateCreateUser dto =
    if System.String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace dto.Name then
        Error "name required"
    else
        Ok dto

let createUser : Flow<AppEnv, string, User> =
    flow {
        let! dto = validateCreateUser incoming
        let! tenant = Flow.read _.TenantId
        return { Name = dto.Name; TenantId = tenant }
    }
```

If the validation story is already richer than `FsFlow.Validate`, keep it richer. FsFlow can receive the outcome, not fight the validation library.

## When To Prefer `FsFlow.Validate`

Use `FsFlow.Validate` when the checks are simple and can stay purely `Result<'value, unit>`-based:

- guard clauses
- option checks
- null checks
- string emptiness checks
- simple collection checks

Use `Validus` when you want a more expressive validation DSL or validation accumulation.
