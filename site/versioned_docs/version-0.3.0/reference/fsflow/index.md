# FsFlow

This page shows the core FsFlow surface by what you do with it, not by namespace.

Use this page when you want the synchronous and async family shape in one place.

## What belongs here

This package groups the synchronous and async workflow families plus the pure validation bridge:

- `Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>` and the `Flow` module
- `AsyncFlow<'env, 'error, 'value>` and the `AsyncFlow` module
- `Validate` for pure `Result<'value, unit>` guards
- support types that shape runtime logging and retry behavior
- the `flow {}` and `asyncFlow {}` entry points

The builder types themselves stay below the surface. The families and their modules are the public story.

## Flow

`Flow` is the synchronous family:

- build from values, options, and results
- read the environment explicitly
- compose with `map`, `bind`, `tap`, and `orElse`
- collect lists and sequences
- bridge into `AsyncFlow` or validation when needed

<p>The `Flow&lt;'env, 'error, 'value&gt;` type and `Flow` module cover synchronous composition, explicit environment reads, short-circuiting, and execution.</p>
<p>The next page expands the full member map, including creation helpers, composition helpers, environment access, traversals, runtime helpers, and interop points.</p>

<h2>Async boundaries</h2>
<p>The `AsyncFlow&lt;'env, 'error, 'value&gt;` type and `AsyncFlow` module cover async composition, `Async` interop, explicit environment reads, and execution.</p>

<section class="docs-card">
<span class="label">Validate</span>
<h2>Pure validation</h2>
<p>`FsFlow.Validate` gives pure `Result&lt;_, unit&gt;` checks for booleans, options, value options, nulls, collections, equality, and strings.</p>
<p>The next page expands the full helper family and the bridges that turn unit failures into application errors.</p>

<section class="docs-card">
<span class="label">Support types</span>
<h3>Supporting types</h3>
<p>These types are useful but narrower in scope: `LogEntry`, `LogLevel`, and `RetryPolicy`.</p>

<section class="docs-card">
<span class="label">Entry points</span>
<h3>Workflow builders</h3>
<p>The `flow {}` and `asyncFlow {}` entry points are available, but the builder types themselves are treated as plumbing rather than headline API.</p>
<p>Use the builders for readable orchestration, and use the modules for the actual API surface.</p>

## AsyncFlow

`AsyncFlow` follows the same shape as `Flow`, but its execution model is async-first:

- lift from synchronous flows when the boundary stays the same
- lift from `Async` and `Async<Result<_, _>>` when the runtime already is async
- keep the same explicit environment model
- bridge to `TaskFlow` only when the application boundary moves to tasks
