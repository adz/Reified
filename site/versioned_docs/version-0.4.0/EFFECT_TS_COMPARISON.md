# Effect-TS Comparison

This page shows FsFlow in relation to Effect-TS without pretending they solve the same problem at the same scale.

## What Carries Over

These ideas are shared:

- typed success and error channels
- explicit dependency access
- compositional workflow values
- runtime helpers for retry, timeout, and cancellation-aware execution

## What Is Different

FsFlow is aimed at ordinary F# application code:

- `flow {}`, `asyncFlow {}`, and `taskFlow {}` instead of generator-based syntax
- first-class interop with `Result`, `Async`, and `.NET Task`
- explicit environment reads such as `Flow.read _.Gateway` or `TaskFlow.read _.Gateway`
- a much smaller surface focused on application flows rather than a broader runtime platform

## What Effect-TS Still Has That FsFlow Does Not

Effect-TS is much broader and more mature. FsFlow does not try to match:

- a richer service and context system
- structured concurrency runtime features
- broader runtime primitives such as streams and channels
- integrated observability tooling
- a large package ecosystem

## Practical Comparison

The useful question for F# users is not "how close is this to Effect-TS?"

The useful questions are:

- is this clearer than `Async<Result<_,_>>` for the flows you actually write?
- do explicit env requirements help enough to justify the abstraction?
- does the workflow-family split make mixed sync, `Async`, and `.NET Task` code easier to keep readable?

## Practical Takeaway

Use FsFlow if you want a small F#-native library for composable flows with explicit dependencies, typed failures, explicit cancellation, and direct `.NET` interop.

Do not evaluate it as a feature-peer to Effect-TS. Evaluate it against the F# code you would otherwise write.
