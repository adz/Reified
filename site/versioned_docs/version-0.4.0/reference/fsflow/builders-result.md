# result

The fail-fast `result { }` computation expression.


```fsharp
let result
```


## Remarks

<para>
Use this builder when the happy path should short-circuit on the first error
and you want to keep the workflow in `Result` shape all the way through.
</para>
<para>
It works well for parsing, validation, and other boundaries where failure is expected
to stop the flow immediately instead of accumulating diagnostics.
