# Capability

This page shows the source-documented capability and layer surface, used for dependency injection and environment management in task workflows.

## Capabilities

- module `Capability`: Capability helpers for record-based environments and .NET service-provider interop. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L710)
- type `Capability.MissingCapability`: Describes a missing service-provider capability. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L712)
- [`Capability.service`](./capability-service.md): Reads a capability from a record-based environment projection. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L719)
- [`Capability.runtime`](./capability-runtime.md): Reads a capability from the runtime half of a two-context runtime environment. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L723)
- [`Capability.environment`](./capability-environment.md): Reads a capability from the application half of a two-context runtime environment. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L729)
- [`Capability.serviceFromProvider`](./capability-servicefromprovider.md): Reads a service from `IServiceProvider` and fails when it is not registered. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L735)

## Layers

- type `Layer`: Layer helpers for deriving an environment in one flow and consuming it in another. [source](https://github.com/adz/FsFlow/blob/main/src/FsFlow/TaskFlow.fs#L752)
