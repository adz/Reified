# catch

Catches exceptions raised during execution and maps them to a typed error.


```fsharp
let catch (handler: exn -> 'error) (flow: Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>) : Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>
```


## Remarks

Exceptions that are not caught by this helper will bubble up to the caller of `run`.
This ensures that known exceptions can be handled within the flow context.


## Parameters

- `handler`: A function of type `exn -> 'error` to map the exception.
- `flow`: The source flow of type `Flow` to monitor.

## Returns

A `Flow` that converts exceptions into success-path errors.
