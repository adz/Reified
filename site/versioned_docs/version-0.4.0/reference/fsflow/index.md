# FsFlow

This page shows the main FsFlow surface by what you do with it, not by namespace.

Use this page when you want the synchronous, async, and task family shape in one place.

## What belongs here

This package groups the synchronous, async, and task workflow families plus the pure validation bridge:

- `Flow<'env, 'error, 'value>` and the `Flow` module
- `AsyncFlow<'env, 'error, 'value>` and the `AsyncFlow` module
- `TaskFlow<'env, 'error, 'value>` and the `TaskFlow` module
- `ColdTask<'value>` and the `ColdTask` module
- `Check` for pure `Result<'value, unit>` predicates
- `Result` for fail-fast helpers
- `Validation` for accumulated diagnostics
- support types that shape runtime logging and retry behavior
- the `flow {}`, `asyncFlow {}`, `taskFlow {}`, `result {}`, and `validate {}` entry points

The builder types themselves stay below the surface. The families and their modules are the public story.

## Flow

`Flow` is the synchronous family:

- build from values, options, and results
- read the environment explicitly
- compose with `map`, `bind`, `tap`, and `orElse`
- collect lists and sequences
- bridge into `AsyncFlow` or validation when needed

<p>The `flow {}`, `asyncFlow {}`, `taskFlow {}`, `result {}`, and `validate {}` entry points are available, but the builder types themselves are treated as plumbing rather than headline API.</p>
<p>Use the builders for readable orchestration, and use the modules for the actual API surface.</p>

## AsyncFlow

`AsyncFlow` follows the same shape as `Flow`, but its execution model is async-first:

- lift from synchronous flows when the boundary stays the same
- lift from `Async` and `Async<Result<_, _>>` when the runtime already is async
- keep the same explicit environment model
- bridge to `TaskFlow` when the application boundary moves to tasks

## TaskFlow

`TaskFlow` follows the same shape as `Flow` and `AsyncFlow`, but its runtime is task-first:

- lift from `Flow` and `AsyncFlow` when the outer boundary already carries them
- lift from `Task`, `Task<Result<_, _>>`, `ValueTask`, `ValueTask<Result<_, _>>`, and `ColdTask`
- keep the same explicit environment model
- preserve cancellation through the boundary
